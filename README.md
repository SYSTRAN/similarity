# similarity
Bilingual sentence similarity classifier based on optimising word alignments using Tensorflow.

This repo implements a sentence similarity classifier model using Tensorflow. Similarity classification is based on the ideas introduced by [Carpuat et al., 2017](http://aclweb.org/anthology/W17-3209) and similar to [Vyas et al., 2018](http://aclweb.org/anthology/N18-1136), [Schwenk, 2018](http://aclweb.org/anthology/P18-2037) and [Gr√©goire et al., 2018](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/C18-1122). The code borrows many of the concepts and architecture presented in [Legrand et al., 2016](http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W16-2207). Further details obout the current implementation and experiments are published in [Pham et al., 2018]() at EMNLP2018.

The next picture, shows an example of similarity classification for the sentence pair:

``` What do you feel ? Not . ||| Que ressentez-vous ?```

As it can be seen, the model outputs:
* a matrix with alignment scores (for each pair of words),
* aggregation scores at the level of source/target words (shown next to words) and
* an overall sentence similarity score (+0.1201).

In the previous paper we show that divergent sentences can be filtered out (using the overal similarity score) and that some divergences can be fixed (following alignment scores), guiding in both cases to outperform accuracy when compared to using the original corpora to learn a neural MT system. For our experiments we used the English-French [OpenSubtitles](http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2016/pdf/947_Paper.pdf) and the English-German [Paracrawl](http://paracrawl.eu/) corpora.

# Preprocess

## Word alignment and Part-of-Speeche tags

Note that to generate some training examples we will need to perform word alignments and POS-tagging of the input sentences. In our experiments we used [fast_align](https://github.com/clab/fast align) to perform word alignment of our corpora and [Freeling](https://github.com/TALP-UPC/FreeLing.git) to obtain English POS tags.
